# TransportManagement
It is a Java Application which is implemented by Java Programming Language and Designed by Java Swing which can be used by Transportation Company to manage their Records and Works. The main objective of this application is to automate the complete operations of the goods transport office.

It is designed by Ashwani Dwivedi and my team member Akash Gupta. 

In current system all work is getting done manually. User have to manage many things so it is very difficult to manage this business doing work manually. Using this system user can automate many transport operation like billing, tracking payments, creating report etc.

You can run this project in your computer system in two ways:-
1) By importing Project on IDE
For this you need to import all the files in your IDE and then you can easily run main file.

2) By downloading executabble jar file
You will get executable jar file TransportManagement.zip file. Simply you need to unzip file and double tab on TransportManagement executable file. 
Then allow permission and complete the installation process.

For both the methods you need to import database in your system. I recommend you to use Xampp server.
Open Xampp server and Click on the import in the above.
Then choose file transport.sql.gz and click on go.

Your Application is now ready to use.
